## Welcome to Conduit!

Conduit is a lightweight, easy-to-use markdown editor.
It uses [GitHub's Flavored Markdown Syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for syntax editing and parsing.

Conduit utilizes [showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) for a live preview of your changes as you edit, and it also has support for tasklists, syntax highlighting, tables, emoji, and more!

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to submit an issue on Conduit's [GitHub page](https://github.com/zackdevine/conduit/issues)!
